PART 2
1a. What are the parent and child classes here?
The Spell is the parent and the Accio and Confundo is the child
1b. What does the code print out? (Try figuring it out without running it in Python)
spell.execute() will print "Summoning Charm"
study_spell(spell) will print "Accio Summoning Charm\n No description"
study_spell(Confundo()) will print "Confundo Confundus Charm\nCauses the victim to become confused and befuddled."
1c. Which get description method is called when ‘study spell(Confundo())’ is executed? Why?
study_spell(Confundo()) going to call Confundo.get_description because the parent's function is in the Confundo class
1d. What do we need to do so that print(Accio()) will print the appropriate description (This charm summons an object to the caster, potentially over a significant distance)?
Override the the parent's get_description function and create inside the Accio class:
    class Accio(Spell):
        def __init__(self):
            Spell.__init__(self, "Accio", "Summoning Charm")

        def get_description(self):
            return "This charm summons an object to the caster, potentially over a significant distance."
